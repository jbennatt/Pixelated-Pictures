# Pixelated Pictures
This project takes an input picture and "pixelates" it by recreating a picture within a picture ([example](https://github.com/jbennatt/Pixelated-Pictures/blob/master/example-picture.png))

This project is not in a finished state. To see how to use it, Look at the file /pixelated_pictures/database/testing/DBWriteTest.java to see how to create a db folder and file. This routine creates a folder, db-test parallel, which will contain the scaled down pictures and a file dbFile.txt, which contains information for each of the (scaled down) files. On line 22, you will see where to specify where to search for pictures to be used for pixelation. Change G:\\Pictures to the root directory where all the pictures you wish to use are (the more there are the better the program will work).

After that is done, /pixelated_pictures/processor/testing/PixelatedBruteTest.java shows how to generate a pixelated picture. ROOT_DIR and DB_DIR are not used (ignore them). You only need DB_FILE and it should point to the directory created above where the file created above will be located (there's a bunch of commented out code which creates the database each run--which is unnecessary if you've already created the DB_FILE). Next choose a picture to pixelate by changing TEST_PIC and then change OUTPUT_FILE to the file you want it saved as.
